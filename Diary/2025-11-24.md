I got a little further. Copilot was not helpful so far.
I drew on my memory of CPP and sprinkled some `#include "rapt_headers.h"` into 
`graphics_core.cpp` and `social_core.cpp` which made the compilation pass, but gave me 
linker errors down the line. So I am onto something here, just not sure what, yet. I also 
had to fix a few broken lines in `os_core.cpp` which felt super dodgy, why would the core 
not be 100% OK!? 

The plan for next session is to undo the added includes and try the AI a bit more if I can't
 get those includes to act right.
